EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: An analysis of the medical records request process reveals that staff experience is the primary driver of operational efficiency. 
Senior staff (Level 3) consistently outperform junior staff (Level 1) in both processing speed and SLA compliance. Key process inefficiencies were identified, with "Lab Report" requests showing the longest turnaround times and the "Review Failed" and "Other Error" stages being the primary source of rejections. Additionally, the data indicate a potential issue with internal stakeholder satisfaction, as "Admins" reported the lowest satisfaction scores among all requester types. These findings suggest that improvements can be made through targeted staff training and specific process reviews.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Staff Performance Analysis: Level 3 staff were the most efficient across all key metrics, while level 1 staff performed the worst. Within each staff level, the highest years of experience performed best.
   
2. Process Bottlenecks: Billings were the most common request type, but they had the second shortest processing rate. Lab reports had the longest processing rates but were one of the less common request types. Rejections occurred most frequently during the 'Review Failed' and 'Other Error' stages, identifying them as key process bottlenecks. Admins had a less satisfactory experience compared to other requester types.

3. Performance Ranking: The best performers within each level had more years of experience in comparison to their peers.
    
BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Targeted Training Program: Implement a targeted training and mentorship program for Level 1 staff, pairing them with high-performing Level 3 staff to improve their speed and SLA compliance.
    
2. Process Review: Initiate a detailed process review for 'Lab Report' requests to identify and address the causes for their long turnaround times. Similarly, analyze the 'Review Failed' stage to reduce the high number of rejections.
    
3. Improve Internal Stakeholder Experience: Conduct follow-up surveys or meetings with 'Admin' and 'Doctor' requesters to understand the reasons for their low satisfaction scores and identify areas for improvement.

4. Knowledge-Sharing Program: Establish a formal knowledge-sharing program where specialists with the highest success rates lead workshops or mentorship sessions.
